This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  Specifically, when the app is opened from a deep link that includes query parameters with special characters (e.g., '+' or '%'), the `Linking.getInitialURL()` method might return `null` or an incorrect URL, preventing proper navigation within the application.  This is inconsistent with the expected behavior and is problematic for apps relying on robust deep link handling.
